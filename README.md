## Project Description: visualizing the relationship between options and the stock market. 

## Questions to Answer: 
* Can 90-day at-the-money options prices accurately and reliably predict the movement (magnitude and direction) of stock prices? 
* Benchmarking: Does the performance of the proposed model beat the SP500? 
* Which variable has the strongest predictive power?

## Potential Datasets: Alpaca API, Google Finance API, Quandl, CBOE/All Access API

## Libraries: PyPI, Pandas, Hvplot, PyViz

## Presentation ideas: 
* bullish and bearish panels - scatter w/ quadrants
* R-squared/correalation of model
* Boxplot of obseved performance for a set of stocks in scope
* Comparison of Prediction Model vs. SP500 (line)
